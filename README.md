# Amazon_Vine_Analysis
### Introduction
The Amazon Vine program is a service that allows manufacturers and publishers to receive reviews for their products. Companies like SellBy pay a small fee to Amazon and provide products to Amazon Vine members, who are then required to publish a review. In this project, the Pet Product dataset containing reviews willbe used with PySpark to perform the ETL process to extract the dataset, transform the data, connect to an AWS RDS instance, and load the transformed data into pgAdmin. Next, PySpark, Pandas, or SQL will be used to determine if there is any bias toward favorable reviews from Vine members in the dataset. Last, a writen summary of the analysis will be submited to the SellBy stakeholders.

Deliverable 1: Perform ETL on Amazon Product Reviews
